Though she is honored to be Chicago Woman of the Year, Victoria Colby-Camp is more euphoric over the mental improvement that her son Jim has shown recently especially since he and Tasha North fell in love.

Review based on a cursory examination by University of Phoenix students in Philosophy 251.  <br />We have found the book to be well organized, and detailed. The structure placed the information in an easy to read and presentable manner. <br />The use of strong and sound proofs by experiment and examples supported the overall logic of reasoning in a clear and concise manner. <br />We have found the book to be well thought out and laid out so the reader can learn and follow what is being explained. <br />
My only complaint is that this book was a bit repetative, and Holden's vocabulary only consists of 4 words: sonuvabitch, goddamn, lousy and phony. It was still quite humorous and the actual story was interesting.<br /><br />It was easy to read and to relate to, so you should pick it up if you're looking for a fun read. Some people complain about the lack of a plot, but to understand this book you need to read deeper into it. It's actually a lot more than some annoying kid's list of complaints about life.<br /><br />The story is about Holden Caulfield's coming of age and realizing that growing up is not a process that can be stopped. He had a lousy childhood, as he puts it, and wants to save other children from going though the things he experienced in his life. He is telling the story from a mental institution, which he was placed in after returning home from the fourth Prep school he had been kicked out of. He flashes back to the events leading up to his arrival at his home and tells the story of those 3 days.
This book is chilling and depressing indeed, though very well written and sprinkled with frequent humor.  I was sort of surprised however by the comment in Publisher's Weekly which said that \\"PW suspects that many of those buyers will be disappointed. Ehrenreich can't deliver the promised story because she never managed to get employed in the 'midlevel corporate world' she wanted to analyze.\\"  I never viewed that as being the \\"promised story\\" in the first place.  To me, the primary point of the book was to describe what it was like to actually try to ENTER that world in the first place rather than describing what life was like when she got there--and that she did.  In fact, I actually thought that she \\"lucked out\\" in a sense by having the bizarre, surreal experiences she did--not only did it make for more entertaining and more thought-provoking reading, but in my mind, if she HAD obtained a job right away, it would have taken away the whole raison d'etre of the book.  It would have been a completely different book in which she merely described her (presumably) boring mid-level corporate job, which probably would have been the same from day to day.  Thus, at least for purposes of writing the book, I think she was \\"lucky\\" that things worked out the way they did.  As for the reader who criticized her for not taking the \\"jobs\\" offered by AFLAC and Mary Kay, I thought those comments were bizarre.  I agree with Ms. Ehrenreich's point in that \\"jobs\\" such as these in which the employer offers no salary, no benefits, no office, no help and essentially takes no risk whatsoever can hardly be considered jobs in the traditional sense she was seeking.  In any event, it's really a pretty scary and depressing book, but one which I recommend.
When looking for &lt;a href=\\"[...]\\">lock picking books&lt;/a>, this one is very informative. It will give one great ideas on opening padlocks, but the language is very basic, no frills here. This is not a romance novel, it's how to open locks without keys, and that's it. You will learn what you need to here. But you should always seek out more knowledge.
Never been much for enjoying history, but the style, brevity, and choice of subject matter come together very nicely in this book.

this
boook
was
a
great
one
that
you
could
learn
from.
it
not
only
teaches
the
imponrtance
of
family
and
their
values
but
it
also
deals
with
basic
issues
that
teens
and
some
kids
even
deal
with.

this
book
is
about
4
best
friends
who
are
for
the
first
time
in
their
lives
spending
their
summer
apart.
one
day
they
are
all
in
one
of
the
girls
rooms
and
finds
a
pair
of
pants
that
were
tucked
away
in
her
closet.

once
all
four

of
them
try
them
on
they
realize
that
there
is
really
something
special
about
these
pants.

seeming
as
how
all
4
girls
are
differnt
shapes
and
sizes
and
somehow
the
pants
fit
all
of
them,

they
realize
that
these
pants
were
the
start
of
something
special.

immediatley
following
they
decided
to
make
up
certian
rules
abut
the
pants
such
as
you
must
write
the
best
thing
u
did
while
wearing
the
pants
over
your
summer
on
the
right
leg
and
also
some
silly
things
such
as
to
\\"never
pick
yuor
nose
while
wearing
the
pants.\\"

this
book
follows
the
girls
throuh
their
summers
in
differnt
places
of
the
world
and
through
all
of
the
different
obstacles
that
life
takes
them
through.
it
can
really
teach
you
alot
not
only
about
what
is
going
on
around
you
but
most
imporntantly
about
yuorself.

i
would
give
this
book
4
stars
and
would
reccommend
it
to
anyone
who
seems
the
slihgtest
bit
interested.
If
you
are
looking
for
something
to
stimulate
your
brain,
this
isn't
it.

However,
if
you
are
just
looking
for
a
good
laugh,
you'll
enjoy
The
Bad
Girl's
Guide.

It's
funny
and
light,
and
definitely
a
good
way
to
pass
a
little
bit
of
time.
never
read
it-a
young
relative
idicated
he
liked
it
and
somehow
my
name
popped
upon
this--no
more
to
say
Though
she
is
honored
to
be
Chicago
Woman
of
the
Year,
Victoria
Colby-Camp
is
more
euphoric
over
the
mental
improvement
that
her
son
Jim
has
shown
recently
especially
since
he
and
Tasha
North
fell
in
love.

Jim
was
snatched
almost
twenty
years
ago
when
he
was
seven
and
turned
into
the
killing
Seth
whose
goal
was
to
murder
Victoria
for
abandoning
him.

However,
her
elation
would
turn
to
despair
if
she
knew
Seth
resurfaced
and
started
to
rape
a
pregnant
Tasha.<br

military
strategist
Daniel
Marks
is
in
town
complements
of
the
Colby
Agency
that
wants
to
hire
him.

Also
in
Chicago
is
Emily
Hastings
whose
father
a
veteran
homicide
detective
was
murdered.

She
finds
letters
linking
her

woman's
long
ago
murdered
first
husband
James,
and
her
dad's
first
partner
Marelyn
Rutland
that
confuses
her.

Soon
she
will
meet
Daniel
and
they
will
be
embroiled
in
the
COLBY
CONSPIRACY
that
goes
back
almost
two
decades
ago.<br
/><br
/>Though
the
subplots
can
become
confusing
at
first,
once
the
audience
comprehends
how
this
complex
superb
suspense

starts
to
come
together,
they

The
ensemble
cast
is
solid
as
fans
will
feel
with
Victoria
who
has
overcome
so
much
tragedy,
hope
Jim
\\"defeats\\"
Seth
with
Tasha

A
final
twist
marks
a
strong
Webb

deceit

her
A-game.<br
/><br
/>Harriet
Klausner
Review
based
on
a
cursory
examination
by
University
of
Phoenix
students
in
Philosophy
251.

<br
/>We
have
found
the
book
to
be
well
organized,
and
detailed.
The
structure
placed
the
information
in
an
easy
to
read
and
presentable
manner.
<br
/>The
use
of
strong
and
sound
proofs
by
experiment
and
examples
supported
the
overall
logic
of
reasoning
in
a
clear
and
concise
manner.
<br
/>We
have
found
the
book
to
be
well
thought
out
and
laid
out
so
the
reader
can
learn
and
follow
what
is
being
explained.
<br
/>
My
only
complaint
is
that
this
book
was
a
bit
repetative,
and
Holden's
vocabulary
only
consists
of
4
words:
sonuvabitch,
goddamn,
lousy
and
phony.
It
was
still
quite
humorous
and
the
actual
story
was
interesting.<br
/><br
/>It
was
easy
to
read
and
to
relate
to,
so
you
should
pick
it
up
if
you're
looking
for
a
fun
read.
Some
people
complain
about
the
lack
of
a
plot,
but
to
understand
this
book
you
need
to
read
deeper
into
it.
It's
actually
a
lot
more
than
some
annoying
kid's
list
of
complaints
about
life.<br
/><br
/>The
story
is
about
Holden
Caulfield's
coming
of
age
and
realizing
that
growing
up
is
not
a
process
that
can
be
stopped.
He
had
a
lousy
childhood,
as
he
puts
it,
and
wants
to
save
other
children
from
going
though
the
things
he
experienced
in
his
life.
He
is
telling
the
story
from
a
mental
institution,
which
he
was
placed
in
after
returning
home
from
the
fourth
Prep
school
he
had
been
kicked
out
of.
He
flashes
back
to
the
events
leading
up
to
his
arrival
at
his
home
and
tells
the
story
of
those
3
days.
This
book
is
chilling
and
depressing
indeed,
though
very
well
written
and
sprinkled
with
frequent
humor.

I
was
sort
of
surprised
however
by
the
comment
in
Publisher's
Weekly
which
said
that
\\"PW
suspects
that
many
of
those
buyers
will
be
disappointed.
Ehrenreich
can't
deliver
the
promised
story
because
she
never
managed
to
get
employed
in
the
'midlevel
corporate
world'
she
wanted
to
analyze.\\"

I
never
viewed
that
as
being
the
\\"promised
story\\"
in
the
first
place.

To
me,
the
primary
point
of
the
book
was
to
describe
what
it
was
like
to
actually
try
to
ENTER
that
world
in
the
first
place
rather
than
describing
what
life
was
like
when
she
got
there--and
that
she
did.

In
fact,
I
actually
thought
that
she
\\"lucked
out\\"
in
a
sense
by
having
the
bizarre,
surreal
experiences
she
did--not
only
did
it
make
for
more
entertaining
and
more
thought-provoking
reading,
but
in
my
mind,
if
she
HAD
obtained
a
job
right
away,
it
would
have
taken
away
the
whole
raison
d'etre
of
the
book.

It
would
have
been
a
completely
different
book
in
which
she
merely
described
her
(presumably)
boring
mid-level
corporate
job,
which
probably
would
have
been
the
same
from
day
to
day.

Thus,
at
least
for
purposes
of
writing
the
book,
I
think
she
was
\\"lucky\\"
that
things
worked
out
the
way
they
did.

As
for
the
reader
who
criticized
her
for
not
taking
the
\\"jobs\\"
offered
by
AFLAC
and
Mary
Kay,
I
thought
those
comments
were
bizarre.

I
agree
with
Ms.
Ehrenreich's
point
in
that
\\"jobs\\"
such
as
these
in
which
the
employer
offers
no
salary,
no
benefits,
no
office,
no
help
and
essentially
takes
no
risk
whatsoever
can
hardly
be
considered
jobs
in
the
traditional
sense
she
was
seeking.

In
any
event,
it's
really
a
pretty
scary
and
depressing
book,
but
one
which
I
recommend.
When
looking
for
&lt;a
href=\\"[...]\\">lock
picking
books&lt;/a>,
this
one
is
very
informative.
It
will
give
one
great
ideas
on
opening
padlocks,
but
the
language
is
very
basic,
no
frills
here.
This
is
not
a
romance
novel,
it's
how
to
open
locks
without
keys,
and
that's
it.
You
will
learn
what
you
need
to
here.
But
you
should
always
seek
out
more
knowledge.
Never
been
much
for
enjoying
history,
but
the
style,
brevity,
and
choice
of
subject
matter
come
together
very
nicely
in
this
book.

      1 If you are looking for something to stimulate your brain, this isn't it.  However, if you are just looking for a good laugh, you'll enjoy The Bad Girl's Guide.  It's funny and light, and definitely a good way to pass a little bit of time.

It was still quite humorous and the actual story was interesting.<br /><br />It was easy to read and to relate to, so you should pick it up if you're looking for a fun read. Some people complain about the lack of a plot, but to understand this book you need to read deeper into it. It's actually a lot more than some annoying kid's list of complaints about life.<br /><br />The story is about Holden Caulfield's coming of age and realizing that growing up is not a process that can be stopped. He had a lousy childhood, as he puts it, and wants to save other children from going though the things he experienced in his life. He is telling the story from a mental institution, which he was placed in after returning home from the fourth Prep school he had been kicked out of.

      1 Though she is honored to be Chicago Woman of the Year, Victoria Colby-Camp is more euphoric over the mental improvement that her son Jim has shown recently especially since he and Tasha North fell in love.  Jim was snatched almost twenty years ago when he was seven and turned into the killing Seth whose goal was to murder Victoria for abandoning him.  However, her elation would turn to despair if she knew Seth resurfaced and started to rape a pregnant Tasha.<br /><br />Former military strategist Daniel Marks is in town complements of the Colby Agency that wants to hire him.  Also in Chicago is Emily Hastings whose father a veteran homicide detective was murdered.  She finds letters linking her dad to Victoria, the woman's long ago murdered first husband James, and her dad's first partner Marelyn Rutland that confuses her.  Soon she will meet Daniel and they will be embroiled in the COLBY CONSPIRACY that goes back almost two decades ago.<br /><br />Though the subplots can become confusing at first, once the audience comprehends how this complex superb suspense thriller starts to come together, they will want more Colby Agency tales; (see FILES FROM THE COLBY AGENCY: THE BODYGUARD'S BABY PROTECTIVE CUSTODY).  The ensemble cast is solid as fans will feel with Victoria who has overcome so much tragedy, hope Jim \\"defeats\\" Seth with Tasha at his side, and root for Daniel and Emily to make it while wondering what really happened two decades ago.  A final twist marks a strong Webb of deceit tale that showcases a fine author on her A-game.<br /><br />Harriet Klausner

      1 this boook was a great one that you could learn from. it not only teaches the imponrtance of family and their values but it also deals with basic issues that teens and some kids even deal with.  this book is about 4 best friends who are for the first time in their lives spending their summer apart. one day they are all in one of the girls rooms and finds a pair of pants that were tucked away in her closet.  once all four  of them try them on they realize that there is really something special about these pants.  seeming as how all 4 girls are differnt shapes and sizes and somehow the pants fit all of them,  they realize that these pants were the start of something special.  immediatley following they decided to make up certian rules abut the pants such as you must write the best thing u did while wearing the pants over your summer on the right leg and also some silly things such as to \\"never pick yuor nose while wearing the pants.\\"  this book follows the girls throuh their summers in differnt places of the world and through all of the different obstacles that life takes them through. it can really teach you alot not only about what is going on around you but most imporntantly about yuorself.  i would give this book 4 stars and would reccommend it to anyone who seems the slihgtest bit interested.

this boook was a great one that you could learn from. it not only teaches the imponrtance of family and their values but it also deals with basic issues that teens and some kids even deal with.  this book is about 4 best friends who are for the first time in their lives spending their summer apart. one day they are all in one of the girls rooms and finds a pair of pants that were tucked away in her closet.  once all four  of them try them on they realize that there is really something special about these pants.  seeming as how all 4 girls are differnt shapes and sizes and somehow the pants fit all of them,  they realize that these pants were the start of something special.  immediatley following they decided to make up certian rules abut the pants such as you must write the best thing u did while wearing the pants over your summer on the right leg and also some silly things such as to \\"never pick yuor nose while wearing the pants.\\"  this book follows the girls throuh their summers in differnt places of the world and through all of the different obstacles that life takes them through. it can really teach you alot not only about what is going on around you but most imporntantly about yuorself.  i would give this book 4 stars and would reccommend it to anyone who seems the slihgtest bit interested.
If you are looking for something to stimulate your brain, this isn't it.  However, if you are just looking for a good laugh, you'll enjoy The Bad Girl's Guide.  It's funny and light, and definitely a good way to pass a little bit of time.
never read it-a young relative idicated he liked it and somehow my name popped upon this--no more to say
Though she is honored to be Chicago Woman of the Year, Victoria Colby-Camp is more euphoric over the mental improvement that her son Jim has shown recently especially since he and Tasha North fell in love.  Jim was snatched almost twenty years ago when he was seven and turned into the killing Seth whose goal was to murder Victoria for abandoning him.  However, her elation would turn to despair if she knew Seth resurfaced and started to rape a pregnant Tasha.<br /><br />Former military strategist Daniel Marks is in town complements of the Colby Agency that wants to hire him.  Also in Chicago is Emily Hastings whose father a veteran homicide detective was murdered.  She finds letters linking her dad to Victoria, the woman's long ago murdered first husband James, and her dad's first partner Marelyn Rutland that confuses her.  Soon she will meet Daniel and they will be embroiled in the COLBY CONSPIRACY that goes back almost two decades ago.<br /><br />Though the subplots can become confusing at first, once the audience comprehends how this complex superb suspense thriller starts to come together, they will want more Colby Agency tales; (see FILES FROM THE COLBY AGENCY: THE BODYGUARD'S BABY PROTECTIVE CUSTODY).  The ensemble cast is solid as fans will feel with Victoria who has overcome so much tragedy, hope Jim \\"defeats\\" Seth with Tasha at his side, and root for Daniel and Emily to make it while wondering what really happened two decades ago.  A final twist marks a strong Webb of deceit tale that showcases a fine author on her A-game.<br /><br />Harriet Klausner
Review based on a cursory examination by University of Phoenix students in Philosophy 251.  <br />We have found the book to be well organized, and detailed. The structure placed the information in an easy to read and presentable manner. <br />The use of strong and sound proofs by experiment and examples supported the overall logic of reasoning in a clear and concise manner. <br />We have found the book to be well thought out and laid out so the reader can learn and follow what is being explained. <br />
My only complaint is that this book was a bit repetative, and Holden's vocabulary only consists of 4 words: sonuvabitch, goddamn, lousy and phony. It was still quite humorous and the actual story was interesting.<br /><br />It was easy to read and to relate to, so you should pick it up if you're looking for a fun read. Some people complain about the lack of a plot, but to understand this book you need to read deeper into it. It's actually a lot more than some annoying kid's list of complaints about life.<br /><br />The story is about Holden Caulfield's coming of age and realizing that growing up is not a process that can be stopped. He had a lousy childhood, as he puts it, and wants to save other children from going though the things he experienced in his life. He is telling the story from a mental institution, which he was placed in after returning home from the fourth Prep school he had been kicked out of. He flashes back to the events leading up to his arrival at his home and tells the story of those 3 days.
This book is chilling and depressing indeed, though very well written and sprinkled with frequent humor.  I was sort of surprised however by the comment in Publisher's Weekly which said that \\"PW suspects that many of those buyers will be disappointed. Ehrenreich can't deliver the promised story because she never managed to get employed in the 'midlevel corporate world' she wanted to analyze.\\"  I never viewed that as being the \\"promised story\\" in the first place.  To me, the primary point of the book was to describe what it was like to actually try to ENTER that world in the first place rather than describing what life was like when she got there--and that she did.  In fact, I actually thought that she \\"lucked out\\" in a sense by having the bizarre, surreal experiences she did--not only did it make for more entertaining and more thought-provoking reading, but in my mind, if she HAD obtained a job right away, it would have taken away the whole raison d'etre of the book.  It would have been a completely different book in which she merely described her (presumably) boring mid-level corporate job, which probably would have been the same from day to day.  Thus, at least for purposes of writing the book, I think she was \\"lucky\\" that things worked out the way they did.  As for the reader who criticized her for not taking the \\"jobs\\" offered by AFLAC and Mary Kay, I thought those comments were bizarre.  I agree with Ms. Ehrenreich's point in that \\"jobs\\" such as these in which the employer offers no salary, no benefits, no office, no help and essentially takes no risk whatsoever can hardly be considered jobs in the traditional sense she was seeking.  In any event, it's really a pretty scary and depressing book, but one which I recommend.
When looking for &lt;a href=\\"[...]\\">lock picking books&lt;/a>, this one is very informative. It will give one great ideas on opening padlocks, but the language is very basic, no frills here. This is not a romance novel, it's how to open locks without keys, and that's it. You will learn what you need to here. But you should always seek out more knowledge.
Never been much for enjoying history, but the style, brevity, and choice of subject matter come together very nicely in this book.

this boook was a great one that you could learn from. it not only teaches the imponrtance of family and their values but it also deals with basic issues that teens and some kids even deal with.  this book is about 4 best friends who are for the first time in their lives spending their summer apart. one day they are all in one of the girls rooms and finds a pair of pants that were tucked away in her closet.  once all four  of them try them on they realize that there is really something special about these pants.  seeming as how all 4 girls are differnt shapes and sizes and somehow the pants fit all of them,  they realize that these pants were the start of something special.  immediatley following they decided to make up certian rules abut the pants such as you must write the best thing u did while wearing the pants over your summer on the right leg and also some silly things such as to \\"never pick yuor nose while wearing the pants.\\"  this book follows the girls throuh their summers in differnt places of the world and through all of the different obstacles that life takes them through. it can really teach you alot not only about what is going on around you but most imporntantly about yuorself.  i would give this book 4 stars and would reccommend it to anyone who seems the slihgtest bit interested.
If you are looking for something to stimulate your brain, this isn't it.  However, if you are just looking for a good laugh, you'll enjoy The Bad Girl's Guide.  It's funny and light, and definitely a good way to pass a little bit of time.
never read it-a young relative idicated he liked it and somehow my name popped upon this--no more to say
Though she is honored to be Chicago Woman of the Year, Victoria Colby-Camp is more euphoric over the mental improvement that her son Jim has shown recently especially since he and Tasha North fell in love.  Jim was snatched almost twenty years ago when he was seven and turned into the killing Seth whose goal was to murder Victoria for abandoning him.  However, her elation would turn to despair if she knew Seth resurfaced and started to rape a pregnant Tasha.Former military strategist Daniel Marks is in town complements of the Colby Agency that wants to hire him.  Also in Chicago is Emily Hastings whose father a veteran homicide detective was murdered.  She finds letters linking her dad to Victoria, the woman's long ago murdered first husband James, and her dad's first partner Marelyn Rutland that confuses her.  Soon she will meet Daniel and they will be embroiled in the COLBY CONSPIRACY that goes back almost two decades ago.Though the subplots can become confusing at first, once the audience comprehends how this complex superb suspense thriller starts to come together, they will want more Colby Agency tales; (see FILES FROM THE COLBY AGENCY: THE BODYGUARD'S BABY PROTECTIVE CUSTODY).  The ensemble cast is solid as fans will feel with Victoria who has overcome so much tragedy, hope Jim \\"defeats\\" Seth with Tasha at his side, and root for Daniel and Emily to make it while wondering what really happened two decades ago.  A final twist marks a strong Webb of deceit tale that showcases a fine author on her A-game.Harriet Klausner
Review based on a cursory examination by University of Phoenix students in Philosophy 251.  We have found the book to be well organized, and detailed. The structure placed the information in an easy to read and presentable manner. The use of strong and sound proofs by experiment and examples supported the overall logic of reasoning in a clear and concise manner. We have found the book to be well thought out and laid out so the reader can learn and follow what is being explained. 
My only complaint is that this book was a bit repetative, and Holden's vocabulary only consists of 4 words: sonuvabitch, goddamn, lousy and phony. It was still quite humorous and the actual story was interesting.It was easy to read and to relate to, so you should pick it up if you're looking for a fun read. Some people complain about the lack of a plot, but to understand this book you need to read deeper into it. It's actually a lot more than some annoying kid's list of complaints about life.The story is about Holden Caulfield's coming of age and realizing that growing up is not a process that can be stopped. He had a lousy childhood, as he puts it, and wants to save other children from going though the things he experienced in his life. He is telling the story from a mental institution, which he was placed in after returning home from the fourth Prep school he had been kicked out of. He flashes back to the events leading up to his arrival at his home and tells the story of those 3 days.
This book is chilling and depressing indeed, though very well written and sprinkled with frequent humor.  I was sort of surprised however by the comment in Publisher's Weekly which said that \\"PW suspects that many of those buyers will be disappointed. Ehrenreich can't deliver the promised story because she never managed to get employed in the 'midlevel corporate world' she wanted to analyze.\\"  I never viewed that as being the \\"promised story\\" in the first place.  To me, the primary point of the book was to describe what it was like to actually try to ENTER that world in the first place rather than describing what life was like when she got there--and that she did.  In fact, I actually thought that she \\"lucked out\\" in a sense by having the bizarre, surreal experiences she did--not only did it make for more entertaining and more thought-provoking reading, but in my mind, if she HAD obtained a job right away, it would have taken away the whole raison d'etre of the book.  It would have been a completely different book in which she merely described her (presumably) boring mid-level corporate job, which probably would have been the same from day to day.  Thus, at least for purposes of writing the book, I think she was \\"lucky\\" that things worked out the way they did.  As for the reader who criticized her for not taking the \\"jobs\\" offered by AFLAC and Mary Kay, I thought those comments were bizarre.  I agree with Ms. Ehrenreich's point in that \\"jobs\\" such as these in which the employer offers no salary, no benefits, no office, no help and essentially takes no risk whatsoever can hardly be considered jobs in the traditional sense she was seeking.  In any event, it's really a pretty scary and depressing book, but one which I recommend.
When looking for &lt;a href=\\"[...]\\">lock picking books&lt;/a>, this one is very informative. It will give one great ideas on opening padlocks, but the language is very basic, no frills here. This is not a romance novel, it's how to open locks without keys, and that's it. You will learn what you need to here. But you should always seek out more knowledge.
Never been much for enjoying history, but the style, brevity, and choice of subject matter come together very nicely in this book.

this boook was great one that you could learn from. it not only teaches the imponrtance of family and their values but it also deals with basic issues that teens and some kids even deal with.  this book is about best friends who are for the first time in their lives spending their summer apart. one day they are all in one of the girls rooms and finds pair of pants that were tucked away in her closet.  once all four  of them try them on they realize that there is really something special about these pants.  seeming as how all girls are differnt shapes and sizes and somehow the pants fit all of them,  they realize that these pants were the start of something special.  immediatley following they decided to make up certian rules abut the pants such as you must write the best thing did while wearing the pants over your summer on the right leg and also some silly things such as to \\"never pick yuor nose while wearing the pants.\\"  this book follows the girls throuh their summers in differnt places of the world and through all of the different obstacles that life takes them through. it can really teach you alot not only about what is going on around you but most imporntantly about yuorself.  would give this book stars and would reccommend it to anyone who seems the slihgtest bit interested.
If you are looking for something to stimulate your brain, this isn'it.  However, if you are just looking for good laugh, you'll enjoy The Bad Girl'Guide.  It'funny and light, and definitely good way to pass little bit of time.
never read it-young relative idicated he liked it and somehow my name popped upon this--no more to say
Though she is honored to be Chicago Woman of the Year, Victoria Colby-Camp is more euphoric over the mental improvement that her son Jim has shown recently especially since he and Tasha North fell in love.  Jim was snatched almost twenty years ago when he was seven and turned into the killing Seth whose goal was to murder Victoria for abandoning him.  However, her elation would turn to despair if she knew Seth resurfaced and started to rape pregnant Tasha.Former military strategist Daniel Marks is in town complements of the Colby Agency that wants to hire him.  Also in Chicago is Emily Hastings whose father veteran homicide detective was murdered.  She finds letters linking her dad to Victoria, the woman'long ago murdered first husband James, and her dad'first partner Marelyn Rutland that confuses her.  Soon she will meet Daniel and they will be embroiled in the COLBY CONSPIRACY that goes back almost two decades ago.Though the subplots can become confusing at first, once the audience comprehends how this complex superb suspense thriller starts to come together, they will want more Colby Agency tales; (see FILES FROM THE COLBY AGENCY: THE BODYGUARD'BABY PROTECTIVE CUSTODY).  The ensemble cast is solid as fans will feel with Victoria who has overcome so much tragedy, hope Jim \\"defeats\\" Seth with Tasha at his side, and root for Daniel and Emily to make it while wondering what really happened two decades ago.  final twist marks strong Webb of deceit tale that showcases fine author on her -game.Harriet Klausner
Review based on cursory examination by University of Phoenix students in Philosophy 251.  We have found the book to be well organized, and detailed. The structure placed the information in an easy to read and presentable manner. The use of strong and sound proofs by experiment and examples supported the overall logic of reasoning in clear and concise manner. We have found the book to be well thought out and laid out so the reader can learn and follow what is being explained. 
My only complaint is that this book was bit repetative, and Holden'vocabulary only consists of words: sonuvabitch, goddamn, lousy and phony. It was still quite humorous and the actual story was interesting.It was easy to read and to relate to, so you should pick it up if you're looking for fun read. Some people complain about the lack of plot, but to understand this book you need to read deeper into it. It'actually lot more than some annoying kid'list of complaints about life.The story is about Holden Caulfield'coming of age and realizing that growing up is not process that can be stopped. He had lousy childhood, as he puts it, and wants to save other children from going though the things he experienced in his life. He is telling the story from mental institution, which he was placed in after returning home from the fourth Prep school he had been kicked out of. He flashes back to the events leading up to his arrival at his home and tells the story of those days.
This book is chilling and depressing indeed, though very well written and sprinkled with frequent humor.  was sort of surprised however by the comment in Publisher'Weekly which said that \\"PW suspects that many of those buyers will be disappointed. Ehrenreich can'deliver the promised story because she never managed to get employed in the 'midlevel corporate world' she wanted to analyze.\\"  never viewed that as being the \\"promised story\\" in the first place.  To me, the primary point of the book was to describe what it was like to actually try to ENTER that world in the first place rather than describing what life was like when she got there--and that she did.  In fact, actually thought that she \\"lucked out\\" in sense by having the bizarre, surreal experiences she did--not only did it make for more entertaining and more thought-provoking reading, but in my mind, if she HAD obtained job right away, it would have taken away the whole raison 'etre of the book.  It would have been completely different book in which she merely described her (presumably) boring mid-level corporate job, which probably would have been the same from day to day.  Thus, at least for purposes of writing the book, think she was \\"lucky\\" that things worked out the way they did.  As for the reader who criticized her for not taking the \\"jobs\\" offered by AFLAC and Mary Kay, thought those comments were bizarre.  agree with Ms. Ehrenreich'point in that \\"jobs\\" such as these in which the employer offers no salary, no benefits, no office, no help and essentially takes no risk whatsoever can hardly be considered jobs in the traditional sense she was seeking.  In any event, it'really pretty scary and depressing book, but one which recommend.
When looking for &lt;href=\\"[...]\\">lock picking books&lt;/>, this one is very informative. It will give one great ideas on opening padlocks, but the language is very basic, no frills here. This is not romance novel, it'how to open locks without keys, and that'it. You will learn what you need to here. But you should always seek out more knowledge.
Never been much for enjoying history, but the style, brevity, and choice of subject matter come together very nicely in this book.

this boook was a great one that you could learn from. it not only teaches the imponrtance of family and their values but it also deals with basic issues that teens and some kids even deal with.  this book is about 4 best friends who are for the first time in their lives spending their summer apart. one day they are all in one of the girls rooms and finds a pair of pants that were tucked away in her closet.  once all four  of them try them on they realize that there is really something special about these pants.  seeming as how all 4 girls are differnt shapes and sizes and somehow the pants fit all of them,  they realize that these pants were the start of something special.  immediatley following they decided to make up certian rules abut the pants such as you must write the best thing u did while wearing the pants over your summer on the right leg and also some silly things such as to \\"never pick yuor nose while wearing the pants.\\"  this book follows the girls throuh their summers in differnt places of the world and through all of the different obstacles that life takes them through. it can really teach you alot not only about what is going on around you but most imporntantly about yuorself.  i would give this book 4 stars and would reccommend it to anyone who seems the slihgtest bit interested.
If you are looking for something to stimulate your brain, this isn't it.  However, if you are just looking for a good laugh, you'll enjoy The Bad Girl's Guide.  It's funny and light, and definitely a good way to pass a little bit of time.
never read it-a young relative idicated he liked it and somehow my name popped upon this--no more to say
Though she is honored to be Chicago Woman of the Year, Victoria Colby-Camp is more euphoric over the mental improvement that her son Jim has shown recently especially since he and Tasha North fell in love.  Jim was snatched almost twenty years ago when he was seven and turned into the killing Seth whose goal was to murder Victoria for abandoning him.  However, her elation would turn to despair if she knew Seth resurfaced and started to rape a pregnant Tasha.Former military strategist Daniel Marks is in town complements of the Colby Agency that wants to hire him.  Also in Chicago is Emily Hastings whose father a veteran homicide detective was murdered.  She finds letters linking her dad to Victoria, the woman's long ago murdered first husband James, and her dad's first partner Marelyn Rutland that confuses her.  Soon she will meet Daniel and they will be embroiled in the COLBY CONSPIRACY that goes back almost two decades ago.Though the subplots can become confusing at first, once the audience comprehends how this complex superb suspense thriller starts to come together, they will want more Colby Agency tales; (see FILES FROM THE COLBY AGENCY: THE BODYGUARD'S BABY PROTECTIVE CUSTODY).  The ensemble cast is solid as fans will feel with Victoria who has overcome so much tragedy, hope Jim \\"defeats\\" Seth with Tasha at his side, and root for Daniel and Emily to make it while wondering what really happened two decades ago.  A final twist marks a strong Webb of deceit tale that showcases a fine author on her A-game.Harriet Klausner
Review based on a cursory examination by University of Phoenix students in Philosophy 251.  We have found the book to be well organized, and detailed. The structure placed the information in an easy to read and presentable manner. The use of strong and sound proofs by experiment and examples supported the overall logic of reasoning in a clear and concise manner. We have found the book to be well thought out and laid out so the reader can learn and follow what is being explained. 
My only complaint is that this book was a bit repetative, and Holden's vocabulary only consists of 4 words: sonuvabitch, goddamn, lousy and phony. It was still quite humorous and the actual story was interesting.It was easy to read and to relate to, so you should pick it up if you're looking for a fun read. Some people complain about the lack of a plot, but to understand this book you need to read deeper into it. It's actually a lot more than some annoying kid's list of complaints about life.The story is about Holden Caulfield's coming of age and realizing that growing up is not a process that can be stopped. He had a lousy childhood, as he puts it, and wants to save other children from going though the things he experienced in his life. He is telling the story from a mental institution, which he was placed in after returning home from the fourth Prep school he had been kicked out of. He flashes back to the events leading up to his arrival at his home and tells the story of those 3 days.
This book is chilling and depressing indeed, though very well written and sprinkled with frequent humor.  I was sort of surprised however by the comment in Publisher's Weekly which said that \\"PW suspects that many of those buyers will be disappointed. Ehrenreich can't deliver the promised story because she never managed to get employed in the 'midlevel corporate world' she wanted to analyze.\\"  I never viewed that as being the \\"promised story\\" in the first place.  To me, the primary point of the book was to describe what it was like to actually try to ENTER that world in the first place rather than describing what life was like when she got there--and that she did.  In fact, I actually thought that she \\"lucked out\\" in a sense by having the bizarre, surreal experiences she did--not only did it make for more entertaining and more thought-provoking reading, but in my mind, if she HAD obtained a job right away, it would have taken away the whole raison d'etre of the book.  It would have been a completely different book in which she merely described her (presumably) boring mid-level corporate job, which probably would have been the same from day to day.  Thus, at least for purposes of writing the book, I think she was \\"lucky\\" that things worked out the way they did.  As for the reader who criticized her for not taking the \\"jobs\\" offered by AFLAC and Mary Kay, I thought those comments were bizarre.  I agree with Ms. Ehrenreich's point in that \\"jobs\\" such as these in which the employer offers no salary, no benefits, no office, no help and essentially takes no risk whatsoever can hardly be considered jobs in the traditional sense she was seeking.  In any event, it's really a pretty scary and depressing book, but one which I recommend.
When looking for &lt;a href=\\"[...]\\">lock picking books&lt;/a>, this one is very informative. It will give one great ideas on opening padlocks, but the language is very basic, no frills here. This is not a romance novel, it's how to open locks without keys, and that's it. You will learn what you need to here. But you should always seek out more knowledge.
Never been much for enjoying history, but the style, brevity, and choice of subject matter come together very nicely in this book.

this boook was a great one that you could learn from. it not only teaches the imponrtance of family and their values but it also deals with basic issues that teens and some kids even deal with.  this book is about 4 best friends who are for the first time in their lives spending their summer apart. one day they are all in one of the girls rooms and finds a pair of pants that were tucked away in her closet.  once all four  of them try them on they realize that there is really something special about these pants.  seeming as how all 4 girls are differnt shapes and sizes and somehow the pants fit all of them,  they realize that these pants were the start of something special.  immediatley following they decided to make up certian rules abut the pants such as you must write the best thing u did while wearing the pants over your summer on the right leg and also some silly things such as to \\"never pick yuor nose while wearing the pants.\\"  this book follows the girls throuh their summers in differnt places of the world and through all of the different obstacles that life takes them through. it can really teach you alot not only about what is going on around you but most imporntantly about yuorself.  i would give this book 4 stars and would reccommend it to anyone who seems the slihgtest bit interested.
If you are looking for something to stimulate your brain, this isn't it.  However, if you are just looking for a good laugh, you'll enjoy The Bad Girl's Guide.  It's funny and light, and definitely a good way to pass a little bit of time.
never read it-a young relative idicated he liked it and somehow my name popped upon this--no more to say
Though she is honored to be Chicago Woman of the Year, Victoria Colby-Camp is more euphoric over the mental improvement that her son Jim has shown recently especially since he and Tasha North fell in love.  Jim was snatched almost twenty years ago when he was seven and turned into the killing Seth whose goal was to murder Victoria for abandoning him.  However, her elation would turn to despair if she knew Seth resurfaced and started to rape a pregnant Tasha.Former military strategist Daniel Marks is in town complements of the Colby Agency that wants to hire him.  Also in Chicago is Emily Hastings whose father a veteran homicide detective was murdered.  She finds letters linking her dad to Victoria, the woman's long ago murdered first husband James, and her dad's first partner Marelyn Rutland that confuses her.  Soon she will meet Daniel and they will be embroiled in the COLBY CONSPIRACY that goes back almost two decades ago.Though the subplots can become confusing at first, once the audience comprehends how this complex superb suspense thriller starts to come together, they will want more Colby Agency tales; (see FILES FROM THE COLBY AGENCY: THE BODYGUARD'S BABY PROTECTIVE CUSTODY).  The ensemble cast is solid as fans will feel with Victoria who has overcome so much tragedy, hope Jim \\"defeats\\" Seth with Tasha at his side, and root for Daniel and Emily to make it while wondering what really happened two decades ago.  A final twist marks a strong Webb of deceit tale that showcases a fine author on her A-game.Harriet Klausner
Review based on a cursory examination by University of Phoenix students in Philosophy 251.  We have found the book to be well organized, and detailed. The structure placed the information in an easy to read and presentable manner. The use of strong and sound proofs by experiment and examples supported the overall logic of reasoning in a clear and concise manner. We have found the book to be well thought out and laid out so the reader can learn and follow what is being explained. 
My only complaint is that this book was a bit repetative, and Holden's vocabulary only consists of 4 words: sonuvabitch, goddamn, lousy and phony. It was still quite humorous and the actual story was interesting.It was easy to read and to relate to, so you should pick it up if you're looking for a fun read. Some people complain about the lack of a plot, but to understand this book you need to read deeper into it. It's actually a lot more than some annoying kid's list of complaints about life.The story is about Holden Caulfield's coming of age and realizing that growing up is not a process that can be stopped. He had a lousy childhood, as he puts it, and wants to save other children from going though the things he experienced in his life. He is telling the story from a mental institution, which he was placed in after returning home from the fourth Prep school he had been kicked out of. He flashes back to the events leading up to his arrival at his home and tells the story of those 3 days.
This book is chilling and depressing indeed, though very well written and sprinkled with frequent humor.  I was sort of surprised however by the comment in Publisher's Weekly which said that \\"PW suspects that many of those buyers will be disappointed. Ehrenreich can't deliver the promised story because she never managed to get employed in the 'midlevel corporate world' she wanted to analyze.\\"  I never viewed that as being the \\"promised story\\" in the first place.  To me, the primary point of the book was to describe what it was like to actually try to ENTER that world in the first place rather than describing what life was like when she got there--and that she did.  In fact, I actually thought that she \\"lucked out\\" in a sense by having the bizarre, surreal experiences she did--not only did it make for more entertaining and more thought-provoking reading, but in my mind, if she HAD obtained a job right away, it would have taken away the whole raison d'etre of the book.  It would have been a completely different book in which she merely described her (presumably) boring mid-level corporate job, which probably would have been the same from day to day.  Thus, at least for purposes of writing the book, I think she was \\"lucky\\" that things worked out the way they did.  As for the reader who criticized her for not taking the \\"jobs\\" offered by AFLAC and Mary Kay, I thought those comments were bizarre.  I agree with Ms. Ehrenreich's point in that \\"jobs\\" such as these in which the employer offers no salary, no benefits, no office, no help and essentially takes no risk whatsoever can hardly be considered jobs in the traditional sense she was seeking.  In any event, it's really a pretty scary and depressing book, but one which I recommend.
When looking for &lt;a href=\\"[...]\\">lock picking books&lt;/a>, this one is very informative. It will give one great ideas on opening padlocks, but the language is very basic, no frills here. This is not a romance novel, it's how to open locks without keys, and that's it. You will learn what you need to here. But you should always seek out more knowledge.
Never been much for enjoying history, but the style, brevity, and choice of subject matter come together very nicely in this book.
